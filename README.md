# README

This project is part of The Odin Project's Curriculum [https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/where-s-waldo-a-photo-tagging-app-javascript]

The final project can be viewed here. [https://top-where-is-waldo.herokuapp.com/]

This project was built with 

- React JS
- HTML
- CSS/SASS
- Ruby on Rails backend

For this projected I created a Where's Waldo game using a React JS front end. The user is able to search for several characters and once a selected guess is made, an API call is made the the backend to verify that the coordinates selected belong to the correct character.
